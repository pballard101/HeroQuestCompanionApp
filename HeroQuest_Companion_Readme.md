# HeroQuest Companion App

A local web-based HeroQuest companion app designed for family game nights. This app runs from a local Node.js server and is accessed via a browser on an iPad or MacBook, which can be mirrored to a TV using AirPlay. The interface is optimized for touch and displays all four party members simultaneously in a 4-up layout.

---

## âœ… Purpose

- Show all 4 party members on screen at once in a **4-up layout** (each occupying 1/4 of a 16:9 screen, horizontally)
- Controlled via **touch** on an iPad or MacBook, **displayed on a TV**

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

### ðŸ›  Backend

- **Node.js + Express**
- Store party data in **JSON files on disk** under `/data/`
- Serve frontend from `/public/`
- API Routes:
  - `GET /api/parties` â€” return list of saved party names
  - `GET /api/party/:name` â€” load specific party JSON
  - `POST /api/party/:name` â€” save updated party JSON
  - `GET /api/items` â€” list all available items and their modifiers
